        <h1>Sanatan Shrivastava</h1>

        <p>
          I'm currently continuing my academic journey as a
          <b>Master's student in Computer Science (MSCS) </b>at<b>
            The University of Texas, Dallas (UTD)</b
          >. Currently, I've been fortunate to get an opportunity to work as a
          <b>Software Engineering Intern</b> at <b>Intel Corporation</b>,
          specifically within their
          <b>Intel Developer Cloud (IDC) Services</b> department, where I've
          delved into <b>Cloud Technologies</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before embarking on my Master's, I completed my from the Indian
          Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Kota, India. My final
          semester at IIIT provided me with a memorable experience as an
          <b> SWE Intern</b> at <b>Samsung Data Systems (SDS)</b>, India. My
          contributions in software development for the American Region were
          acknowledged with a full-time employment offer as a Software
          Development Engineer - I (Senior Executive) at Samsung SDS India.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interest in utilizing Machine Learning for practical applications
          was manifested in a project I worked on last year alongside Dr. Basant
          Agarwal and Dr. Sonal Jain. We explored various
          <b>Machine Learning </b>algorithms including SVM, AdaBoost, Random
          Forest, and Logistic Regression to develop a novel approach for
          automating the diagnosis of a handwriting disorder called Dysgraphia.
          Our breakthroughs in this field led to the creation of the 'Technology
          Interventions for Learning Disabilities', a significant initiative
          under the Ministry of Human Resources and Development (MHRD),
          Government of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the year 2020-21, I collaborated with Dr. Priyanka Mishra on a
          fascinating project that used
          <b>Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)</b>
          to automate standard wheelchairs for Quadraplegics. Our vision was to
          increase user convenience with minimal human intervention. When I'm
          not engrossed in my academic pursuits, I delve into the world of
          research articles, as they offer me clarity and deeper understanding
          of topics that pique my interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionately exploring the intersection of AI and healthcare. In
          terms of leisure, I am an avid badminton player, a podcast enthusiast,
          and a fan of non-fiction literature. One of my favorite things to do
          is listen to the wisdom shared by

          during my downtime.
